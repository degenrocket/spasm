#### Multi-signing

In 2024, Spasm V2 went live, enabling groundbreaking multi-signing, which allowed users to simultaneously sign the same message with multiple private keys using different protocols and broadcast the message to different networks.

A multi-signed message has multiple authors (public keys), which enables integration of features from different ecosystems. For example, non-unique usernames can be fetched from Nostr meta events (kind 0), while unique usernames can be fetched from blockchain-based NFT-powered naming services like ENS. Different social graph solutions can be plugged from various ecosystem.
