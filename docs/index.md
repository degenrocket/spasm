The Signer and Protocol Agnostic Social Media (Spasm) is the only truly open ecosystem, which is agnostic to signing keys, messaging protocols, transport layers, and storage infrastructure.

Users are able to sign messages with any private key of their choice and trigger the propagation of those messages in any network they want, via any transport protocol, or even all at once.

Spasm is the next step in the evolution of social media after various signature-based decentralized solutions like Secure Scuttlebutt, Steem/Hive, Nostr, Farcaster, Lens, Bluesky, etc.
