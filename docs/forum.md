#### Spasm-powered forum

There will be all sorts of Spasm-compatible apps in the future, but the first one is a Spasm-powered forum, also known as DegenRocket.

A few examples of Spasm-powered forums that run DegenRocket are [forum.spasm.network](https://forum.spasm.network), [degenrocket.space](https://degenrocket.space), and [monero.top](https://monero.top).

These forums run [degenrocket-web](https://github.com/degenrocket/degenrocket-web) for UI and [degenrocket-server](https://github.com/degenrocket/degenrocket-server) for API.

#### Moderation

Each Spasm-powered forum is highly customizable, allowing admins to set their own moderation rules.

New moderators can be set via an admin panel and whitelists can be enabled for certain types of events (posts, comments, reactions).

#### Customization

Spasm-powered forums aim at restoring the freedom of association, so they are modular and highly customizable.

Admins can adjust feed filters, color theme, social links, metadata, title, description, and much more.

Different private keys and networks can be enabled/disabled for ideological or other reasons.

To provide the best experience, admins can configure various modules:
- Spasm
- Nostr
- RSS
